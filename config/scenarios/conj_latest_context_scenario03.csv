#;;;;;;;;;;because 9-12 base profiles belongs to one of base profile and 12 is used as context. Distance between context and any avaliable base profile is greater than 2, so it answers based only on 12;;11 is used as context and 9 and 10 are also selected to grounding sets becuse distance between context and {9, 10} is < 2
